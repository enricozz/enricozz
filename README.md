<p>Hi, my name is Enrico Zangari. I am a Brazilian developer for fun. This website is just to keep track of things I have learned over the years. I have developed a great taste for technology, and I believe a website like this allows me to share all of those things with whoever is reading.</p>

<p>I am a great supporter of open source, which is why I am on platforms such as GitHub 🥳</p>
